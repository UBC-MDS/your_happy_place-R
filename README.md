# Your Happy Place!

Welcome to Your Happy Place - YHP!

Are you at the crossroads of your life?

Are you done with a chapter of your life - beautiful or trying as it was - and ready for your next adventure?

We are here for you!

At Your Happy Place, you will be able to find your next base according to your very own preferences. Compare weather, schools, healthcare, cost of living and more among over 8,000 US counties!

The dashboard below is the weather app component of YHP.

1. On the right hand-side, you begin by selecting whether to color the states and the counties within the state by temperature, by percentage of the days that it rains or by percentage of the days that it snows. Then, you can begin your comparison process.

2. On the top left, the map of the USA is now colored according to your selection. Hover over it to see individual values for the states. Click on the state to select it, and see it appear in the center-top cell.

3. Counties within the state are colored according to the same preferences that you selected in Step 1. Hover over the counties to see individual values. Click the county to select it, and see it appear in the menu on the right-hand side. The county will start in "checked" state and immediately appear in the five plots with the designated color.

4. You may remove the county from the "selected counties" menu by clicking on it on the state map. You may also simply un-check it on the right-hand side and it will no longer show up on the plots.

Below please find the small demo of the app:
